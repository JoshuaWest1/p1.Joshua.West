## I have posted 2 different PDEs, one named as required and one name WITH _AUDIO, techniccally the WITH_AUDIO version is the true correct version, however I Processing is finicky with Libraries

These are images from the Elevator at my job in Fort Worth

gif 1 & 2

#### The issues with the Panel:

Despite the elevator only going to 4 floor, there are numerous issues with the design of the elevator panel.

1.)Most prominent is that the floor numbers are hard to see, since the designers used black numbers on a black background.

2.)Another issue it is that the button layout is not immedietly understandable, being in a 2x2 square with 3 & 4 at the top and 1 & 2 at the bottom.

3.)What can't be well displayed in the Pictures & Gifs is that the panel is deceptively high, to tall for those who are shorter, such as children & the differently abled.


#### Why its not bad

Other than those three issues the Panel is well designed, with a high focus on the primary floor select buttons, the two open & close buttons being clear & with similair design, & the bell icon being very unique & visible for quick location in case of an emergency.

#### Uses

The most common use of an elevator is for people to easily travesre various floors without the need to uses stairs, it also allows people to move basic items with more ease, such as box & chairs.


Less common uses of an elevator may be to access special out of reach rooms, such as employee only service rooms, or even to move large object such as logs & machinering in construction settings.

For the most common uses, the designer made the panel design to be as immeditly understandable. This was done by making the primary buttons, the floor selection buttons, the center peice & the most prominent feature.

#### Sequnce
The common sequence of actions is for a person(s) to enter the elevator, to select their desired floors, & to press the "Close Door" button

#### Clarity
The Elevator shows the user how to use it by presenting the Floor selection buttons as the most prominent feature, closest to the users reach.
Secondary actions, such as close/open doors being the next most featured selection, being set further below the floor selections. & then the tercherary button, the Bell, is furthest away but also uniquly designed to catch your eye, so that in the case of emergency is it easily locatable.

#### Feedback
The main point of feedback present within this panel is that whenever a button has been selected, it will light up to tell the user that they have made a selection.

#### Mistakes
Since the Floor Numbers & their backgrounds are both colored black, a user may mistakenly chose a floor they didnt not want due to them being unable to read the floor numbers properly.

#### Improvments
To improve to the panel Layout I recomend:

1.) Changing the 2x1 rectangular button layout to label buttons instead. This why your button number will be directly over its correlating button & will be more immedietly understandable.

2.) Change the button layout from a 2x2 square of buttons to a vertical line of inreasing buttons, that way even if someone can't read/undestand the numbers on the panel, they can still infer that that bottom button is Floor 1 & the top buttom is Floor 4.

3.) Do a simailr method for the secondary & tertiary buttons but further to the right, this is to keep the format symmetrical and easilly reachable

4.) Between the 2 button sets should be a screen, this could relay info such as Current floor, upcoming floors, etc.

# A
## Its nearly 12pm I dont have time to think of another joke
The final panel I created in Processing ended up being slighty differnt than my proposed sketch, due to discovered insight & due to technical difficulties.
For example, whilst I retained the general layout, I modified the shapes & spacing of the Panel by making the screen Shorter but also wider, this way in totality it is more compact, but also allows for a more readable expeirence.

I also bunched the buttons closer together, that way they are more reachable for a slightly wider range of users.

But unfortuanly there were some hiccups in the process, I, either due to my ineptidute or due to the limitations of Processing, wasnt able to include the GIF I made for changing floors( I posted it below because I still like it). So in its place I instead used a white vertical bar that moves in accordance to the current floor, this way current floor will be usable by users who both can read the current loor message, but also by those who cant, but can infer that the bar coresponds with the floor.

Below are two gifs showing the functions of my Panel

The first shows how my mockup panel is able to detect when ones mouse(hand) is hovering above the buttons, as well as, once clicked, the buttons light up letting the user know that they have managed to select a Button.

The 2nd gif shhows how when a floor, or in this case floors, gets selected, the buttons lights up. But the floor doesnt immedietly change, instead the panel simulates the travel time it takes to reach each floor(this gif is sped-Up, but in reality it takes 5 seconds to move between floors)
