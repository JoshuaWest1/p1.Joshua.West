#### The issues with the Panel:

Despite the elevator only going to 4 floor, there are numerous issues with the design of the elevator panel.

1.)Most prominent is that the floor numbers are hard to see, since the designers used black numbers on a black background.

2.)Another issue it is that the button layout is not immedietly understandable, being in a 2x2 square with 3 & 4 at the top and 1 & 2 at the bottom.

3.)What can't be well displayed in the Pictures & Gifs is that the panel is deceptively high, to tall for those who are shorter, such as children & the differently abled.


#### Why its not bad

Other than those three issues the Panel is well designed, with a high focus on the primary floor select buttons, the two open & close buttons being clear & with similair design, & the bell icon being very unique & visible for quick location in case of an emergency.

#### Uses

The most common use of an elevator is for people to easily travesre various floors without the need to uses stairs, it also allows people to move basic items with more ease, such as box & chairs.

Less common uses of an elevator may be to access special out of reach rooms, such as employee only service rooms, or even to move large object such as logs & machinering in construction settings.

For the most common uses, the designer made the panel design to be as immeditly understandable. This was done by making the primary buttons, the floor selection buttons, the center peice & the most prominent feature.

#### Sequnce
The common sequence of actions is for a person(s) to enter the elevator, to select their desired floors, & to press the "Close Door" button

#### Clarity
The Elevator shows the user how to use it by presenting the Floor selection buttons as the most prominent feature, closest to the users reach.
Secondary actions, such as close/open doors being the next most featured selection, being set further below the floor selections. & then the tercherary button, the Bell, is furthest away but also uniquly designed to catch your eye, so that in the case of emergency is it easily locatable.

#### Feedback
The main point of feedback present within this panel is that whenever a button has been selected, it will light up to tell the user that they have made a selection.

#### Mistakes
Since the Floor Numbers & their backgrounds are both colored black, a user may mistakenly chose a floor they didnt not want due to them being unable to read the floor numbers properly.
