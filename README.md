Despite the elevator only going to 4 floor, there are numerous issues with the design of the elevator panel.

Most prominent is that the floor numbers are hard to see, since the designers used black numbers on a black background.

Another issue it is that the button layout is not immedietly understandable, beiing in a 2x2 square with 3 & 4 at the top and 1 & 2 at the bottom.
